# Home page

This is the English version of the Software Development Guidelines.

## Disclaimer

This guide is a collection of rules and recommendations based on the authors' experience and knowledge of software development.
The authors are not liable for any damages resulting from the use of these rules.
Use the rules at your own risk.

## AI-assisted texts

Many of the texts in this guide have been **assisted** by AI systems during the writing process, and have been adapted or rewritten accordingly.
The texts were promptly and carefully reviewed, revised and checked against sources by the authors.
The process was designed so that the authors retained control of the content, while the AI systems were used as supporting tools.
Texts were always generated in small chunks (1-3 sentences) and then revised and adapted by the authors.
Whole sections or chapters were never generated by AI systems at once.

Nevertheless, errors may have crept in!
