You may create a pull request or open an issue.

**Currently only GERMAN language is supported as the base of the guidelines.**

## Other languages

If you want to contribute to the guidelines in another language, you can do so by creating a new folder in the `guidelines` folder with the language code of the language you want to add.

**Be aware that currently only the German language will receive new rules and guidelines.
So you will have to update the rules and guidelines in the new language yourself.**

## Documents in Markdown

- The guidelines are written in markdown.
- You need the Linter `markdownlint` to check the markdown files.
- Every sentence must start at the beginning of a new line (in this way merging can be done easier).
- You must follow the structure of the guidelines already in place.
- Just copying already existing guidelines and translating them is not enough.
You must also adapt the rules and guidelines in your own words (with the help of AI if necessary).
- If you copy text from other works, you must provide the source and mark the text as a quote.
A maximum of 2-3 sentences may be copied from other works (and only if it is absolutely necessary).
- It is important that the guidelines are understandable and easy to read.
